**Estrondeira Defense is a thrilling tower defense game crafted with Unity, harking back to my early development days in 2016/2017. I carefully modeled and textured all elements of the game using Blender, creating an engaging and unique visual experience.**

## **Key Features:**

### **Interactive Menu:**
  - Users are greeted by a user-friendly menu providing options to play, adjust settings (like volume and resolution), or exit the game.

### **In-Game Lives:**
  - A live system that adds challenge and promotes strategic thinking to survive the enemy waves.

### **Currency System:**
Kill enemies to earn in-game currency. The more enemies you defeat, the richer you become, unlocking the ability to deploy more powerful turrets.

### **Deployable Turrets:**
Players can strategically plant turrets on the game field to fend off waves of enemies, reminiscent of the gameplay mechanics in Plants vs Zombies. 

### **Versatile Turret Types:**
Three unique turret types each with their own animations and powers:
- Rapid Fire Turret: Unleashes a barrage of bullets at enemies.
- Missile Turret: Launches missiles that deal area damage to nearby foes.
- Slowdown Turret: Decelerates enemies while continuously inflicting damage.

### **Turret Upgrades & Selling:**
Players can choose to upgrade their turrets for enhanced firepower or sell them for a fraction of the original cost, adding another layer of strategic decision-making to the gameplay.

### **Level Progression:**
Engage in an escalating challenge across three distinct levels, each demanding a different strategy to prevail.
